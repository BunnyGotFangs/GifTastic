Homework 6 - API dynamic page


WHAT THE PROJECT DOES:
The project is a test of one's ability or in my case NOT ability for how to connect to another source and pull data into my site. 

In this case we will have an API to giphy, and will pull informtion back (10 results). The results will be based upon the button the person selects. 

The buttons are an array and the array can be added to.



WHY IT IS USEFUL:

Other can use the code when working to build or test their API to the giphy site, they will need their own unique key preferrable, but gain the code cn be used to folks testing or building their own little repo.



START FROM HERE: 

    1. click any button on the page and you should get 10 results
    2. input info into the whats your poison and click the Add Now 
            new button should be created
    3. repeat step 1
    4. when you refresh, the page will have the initil button, the results will clear and you can begin again
    5. you can add as many button as you would like
